      <h1>Wavelength over video call</h1>
      <p>
        This web app is intended to temporarily give those who already own the game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/262543/wavelength">Wavelength</a> an opportunity to play with friends over video call during the pandemic. It is not endorsed by the creators of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        To play successfully you need to understand two things:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Every room is its own little universe so in order to play together, you need to share the invite link with your friends.
          </li>
          <li>
            Everyone in a room sees the same things so you have to close your eyes when you're not the clue giver. And if you try to cheat, others will probably notice.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        So buy the game, read the rules and <a @click="setupWavelength('en')">play Wavelength responsibly</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For certain groups, <a @click="setupWavelength('sc')">the scientific version</a> may be fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eller <a @click="setupWavelength('se')">spela p√• svenska</a>.
